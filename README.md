# Repository HowTo

This repository contains the source code for the software project. It is a git repository, which means it uses Git, a version control system, to manage changes to the codebase.

## Getting Started
To get started, you'll need to clone this repository onto your local machine. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
git clone <repository URL>
```

## Making Changes
Once you have the repository cloned onto your machine, you can start making changes to the code. You can use any text editor or IDE you prefer to make these changes.

When you're ready to commit your changes, run the following command:
```bash
git add .
```

This will stage all changes you've made. You can also stage individual files by replacing '.' with the name of the file.

Next, you'll need to commit your changes. Run the following command:

```bash
git commit -m "Your commit message here"
```

Replace "Your commit message here" with a short, descriptive message that summarizes the changes you've made. This message will be visible to others who view the commit history.

## Pushing Changes
After you've committed your changes, you'll need to push them to the remote repository so that others can see them. Run the following command:

```bash
git push
```

This will push your changes to the remote repository.

## Pulling Changes
If someone else has made changes to the repository that you don't have on your local machine, you'll need to pull those changes before you can make further changes. Run the following command:

```bash
git pull
```

This will pull the latest changes from the remote repository to your local machine.
